                <p>Great Blue Orange Consulting, based in Traverse City, Michigan, was in need of a way to build their brand and connect with potential clients. My solution was the design and development of a website that leverages their brand to showcase their unique approach and proven track record of leading successful community initiatives.

            The target audiences for this website were potential clients and community members interested in community-based initiatives, the public sector, and politics. Since not every user would be tech savvy, it was imperative that the website architecture be approachable and easy to navigate.

                <p>
                    As a company that advises mostly tax-exempt entities in the greater Northern Michigan region, from public school districts to wildlife organizations to political campaigns, the website also needed to reflect a sense of community and have a regional focus. Pictures of community members and the natural beauty of northern Michigan feature prominently on the website. I leveraged the blue and orange colors in their brand and the imagery to draw further emphasis to the name of their company, which was born from their love of the Northern Michigan region.
